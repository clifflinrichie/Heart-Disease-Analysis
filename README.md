# Heart Disease Analysis
This was an experiment to test numerous functions and graphics in R, using packages such as tidyverse and ggplot. A popular dataset on heart disease was chosen since it had easily convertable data and offered both credibility and reliability. The data had to be manipulated somewhat since the data scraped off of Kaggle was inaccurate. 

The pdf contains a summary of the data analysis, and provides several numerical and graphical summaries as well as all the code that was used to create them.
